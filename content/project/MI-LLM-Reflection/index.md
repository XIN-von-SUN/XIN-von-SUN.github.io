Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a counseling technique that promotes behavioral change through reflective responses to mirror or refine client statements. While advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate engaging dialogues, challenges remain for applying them in a sensitive context such as MI. This work assesses the potential of LLMs to generate MI reflections via three LLMs: GPT-4, Llama-2, and BLOOM, and explores the effect of dialogue context size and integration of MI strategies for reflection generation by LLMs. We conduct evaluations using both automatic metrics and human judges on four criteria: appropriateness, relevance, engagement, and naturalness, to assess whether these LLMs can accurately generate the nuanced therapeutic communication required in MI. While we demonstrate LLMs' potential in generating MI reflections comparable to human therapists, content analysis shows that significant challenges remain. By identifying the strengths and limitations of LLMs in generating empathetic and contextually appropriate reflections in MI, this work contributes to the ongoing dialogue in enhancing LLM's role in therapeutic counseling.
