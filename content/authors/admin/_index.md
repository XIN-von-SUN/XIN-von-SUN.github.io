## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam (UvA), supervised by Prof. Dr. Jos A.Bosch, Ass. Prof Dr. Abdallah El Ali, and Ass. Prof Dr. Jan de Wit. Prior to that, I received my BSc in Mathematics from Xidian University and MSc in computer science from Heidelberg University under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Artur Andrzejak.

My research interest focuses on NLP/AI and human-computer interaction, with a focus on the trustworthiness, controllability, and explainability of generative AI in applications such as psychotherapy, health intervention, and emotional companionship.
